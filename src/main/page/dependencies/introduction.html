<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>
	{{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} and the {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} offer a wide range of possibilities to include external code into your project. Besides pulling library as managed dependencies from the web and dumping {{ command( '*.jar' ) }} files to a {{ command( 'libs/' ) }} folder, you can also create {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} sub-projects or reference code from a {{ names.name( 'git' ) }} repository.
