<p>
	Developing with the Scala on Android toolchain is a considerably resource intensive undertaking. Depending on your editor and whether you keep emulators running during development or not, the memory consumption does vary greatly. You should be equipped with at least 4GB of RAM to cover the common use cases that are demonstrated in this documentation. Since compiling Scala code is known to be a tedious process, a fast CPU might improve this for you.
