<h3><em>Butterknife</em></h3>

<p>
	The last {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} code example may be simplified further if your use case requires the view reference to be a class field.
</p>

{{ code( 'page/typed-resources/activity3.scala' ) }}

<p>
	This does however force you to take care when accessing the {{ command( 'title' ) }} field because it will evaluate to {{ command( 'null' ) }} when the {{ command( 'setContentView()' ) }} class has not been executed yet. The workflow is very similar to the famous {{ sourcelink( 'android-butterknife' ) }} library, but works with simple language features and is much more transparent.
