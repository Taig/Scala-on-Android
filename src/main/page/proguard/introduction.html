	<p>
		The {{ names.name( 'proguard' ) }} tool shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates your code by removing unused code and renaming classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure names. The result is a smaller sized {{ command( '.apk' ) }} file that is more difficult to reverse engineer.

<p>
	In the {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} world, {{ names.name( 'proguard' ) }} is an optional step of the build process. With {{ names.name( 'scala-android' ) }} it becomes a necessity. You need {{ names.name( 'proguard' ) }} to remove unused classes and methods. The {{ names.name( 'android' ) }} toolchain will fail to compile your app if it contains more than 65.536 methods and fields (the so-called <em>65k limit</em>). This limit is easy to reach when you have the {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} library in your dependencies. Using {{ names.name( 'proguard' ) }} to strip out unused library classes solves this issue. Unfortunately, {{ names.name( 'proguard' ) }} execution is a very time consuming process and its configuration requires a custom syntax.
