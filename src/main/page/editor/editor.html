	Any editor that you previously used for {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} developemnt will also work for your {{ names.name( 'android' ) }} purpose. However, advanced {{ names.abbreviation( 'ide' ) }} features, such as building and deploying your app, debugging or testing, may not be possible with some products or require at least some configuration.
