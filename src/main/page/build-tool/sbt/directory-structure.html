						<p>
							Your actual build configuration. Here you specify your (sub-) projects, manage application dependencies and configure <em>ProGuard.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also manage your build via {{ command( '/build.sbt' ) }}. However, {{ command( '/project/Build.scala' ) }} is written in actual Scala code, is slightly more expressive and allows you to keep all of your configuration files in the {{ command( '/project' ) }} folder.

						<p>
							An optional, but recommended file that specifies the <em>sbt</em> version for this build.

						<span>plugins.sbt</span>
						<p>
							Dependencies for <em>sbt</em> are managed in this file. This is necessary, as we need to rely on <em>Android SDK Plugin for SBT</em> here.
