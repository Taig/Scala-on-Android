<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
	To install {{ names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }}, {{ sourcelink( 'sbt-download', ' download' ) }} it from the official website and follow the {{ sourcelink( 'sbt-tutorial-setup', 'install instructions' ) }}. The {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} requires no manual download, but will instead be loaded by {{ names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }} as a dependency, which will be explained later. Please make sure to read the excellent article {{ sourcelink( 'blog-47deg-configuration' ) }} by <em>47 Degrees</em> if you are starting from zero.
