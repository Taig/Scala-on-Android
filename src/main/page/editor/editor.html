<h2>Editors and {{ names.abbr( 'ide' ) }}s</h2>

<p>
	Any editor that you previously used for {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} developemnt should also work for your {{ names.name( 'android' ) }} purpose. However, advanced {{ names.abbr( 'ide' ) }} features, such as building and deploying your app, debugging or testing, may not be possible with some products or require at least some configuration.
</p>

<p>
	This documentation illustrates how to achieve these important tasks from the {{ names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }} command line and does also provide instructions how to configure the recommended {{ names.abbr( 'ide' ) }}, {{ sourcelink( 'intellij-idea' ) }}, to integrate these feautres.
</p>

{% call alert( 'warning' ) %}
	<p>
		The state of {{ names.abbr( 'ide' ) }} support is <strong>very</strong> fragile. Frequent updates to neccessary {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} or {{  names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }} plugins tend to break features. It is therefore highly advised to not rely on {{ names.abbr( 'ide' ) }} features too heavily and instead get comfortable with the {{  names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }} command line.
