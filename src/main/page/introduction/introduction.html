<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	Android applications are usually developed with the Java programming language and the Android Software Development
	Kit (Android SDK). The program code you write gets compiled to Java bytecode and is then translated to so-called
	<em>Dalvik bytecode</em> (an Android-specific format). On the actual device the <em>Android Runtime (ART)</em> is
	then able to execute these instructions. For you, as an application developer, this process is entirely happening
	behind scenes and does not affect you. It does, however, leave you the freedom to decide how to generate your
	bytecode.
</p>

<p>
	Although Java is the only officially supported and documented language to create SDK apps, Android’s implicit
	compatibility with Java bytecode opens the door to a variety of other Java Virtual Machine (JVM) technologies. In
	fact, every JVM programming language that is able to interop with Java programs might be used as a fully functional
	alternative to Java.

<p>
	The Scala programming language is one out of several JVM technologies that fulfills this requirement. On top of that
	it covers most features of Java and adds a variety of highly useful capabilities, such as: type inference,
	functional programing paradigms, actor-based concurrency and traits (as an improvement to Java interfaces) to just
	mention a few of them. Scala’s steadily growing community has recently created a couple of ambitious projects aiming
	to make Scala on Android a compelling experience.
</p>

<p>
	But be warned: Leaving the safe haven of Google's Java environment does not come without a price. To enjoy the
	benefits of Scala on Android you have to not only sacrifice official tooling support and deal with longer compile
	times but you also have a much tougher build configuration ahead of you to get basic things working. If you still
	think that Scala is worth the hassle, this documentation is there to guide you past the rough edges.

		When you have no experience with either Scala or Android development yet, please consider that both technologies
		come with quite a steep learning curve. It is highly recommended to first get a basic understanding for both
		technologies separately.
