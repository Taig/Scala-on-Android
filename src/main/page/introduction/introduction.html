<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	Android applications are usually developed with the Java programming language and the Android Software Development Kit (Android SDK). The program code you write gets compiled to Java bytecode and is then translated to so-called <em>Dalvik bytecode</em> (an Android-specific format). On the actual device the <em>Android Runtime (ART)</em> is then able to execute these instructions. For you, as an application developer, this process is entirely happening behind scenes and does not affect you. It does, however, leave you the freedom to decide how to generate your bytecode.
</p>

<p>
	Although Java is the only officially supported and documented language to create SDK apps, Android’s implicit compatibility with Java bytecode opens the door to a variety of other Java Virtual Machine (JVM) technologies. In fact, every JVM programming language that is able to interop with Java programs might be used as a fully functional alternative to Java.

	The Scala programming language is one out of several JVM technologies that fulfills this requirement. On top of that it covers most features of Java and adds a variety of highly useful capabilities, such as: type inference, functional programing paradigms, actor-based concurrency and traits (as an improvement to Java interfaces) to just mention a few of them. Scala’s steadily growing community has recently created a couple of ambitious projects aiming to make Scala on Android a compelling experience.
