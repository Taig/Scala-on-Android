<h2>About this documentation</h2>

<p>
	The {{ names.name( 'scala-android' ) }} documentation is an attempt to make the subject more accessible for beginners and to provide a reliable source for information about advanced topics. This is not an easy task, given the fast pace of the {{ names.name( 'android' ) }} and {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} progress. For this reason, the website tries to make it as easy as possible to spot potentially outdated information and to be updated by the community.
