<h3>{{ names.name( 'g8' ) }}</h3>

<p>
	{{ names.name( 'g8' ) }} is a command line utility that scaffolds projects from special {{ names.name( 'gh' ) }} repositories (so-called <em>templates</em>). It is written in {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} and leverages some {{ names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }} features, but it may generally be used to scaffold any kind of projects.
</p>

<p>
	There are a couple {{ names.name( 'scala-android' ) }} templates available on the {{ sourcelink( 'g8-templates' ) }} page, they don't seem particularly well maintained and up to date, though.
