<h3>Target audience</h3>

<p>
	This documentation teaches you how to properly use and configure {{ names.name( 'scala-android' ) }}. It neither teaches you {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} nor {{ names.name( 'android' ) }} development.
</p>

{% call alert( warning ) %}
	<p>
		When you have no experience with either {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} or {{ names.name( 'android' ) }} development yet, please consider that both technologies come with quite a steep learning curve. It is highly recommended to first get a basic understanding for both technologies separately.
