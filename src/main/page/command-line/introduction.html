<h2>Working with the command line</h2>

<p>
	Even though it it possible to configure your {{ names.abbreviation( 'ide' ) }} to handle some basic tasks such as compiling and running your app, or executing tests, you will eventually fall back to the command line in order to fix build issues or trigger more advanced tasks. It is therefore inevitable to get a basic understanding for the {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} command line.
</p>

<p>
	The interactive {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} shell is started by simply typing {{ command( 'sbt' ) }} and hitting enter in your terminal. Alternatively, to only run a single {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} command, it is possible to pass an argument to {{ command( 'sbt' ) }}, e.g. {{ command( 'sbt android:packageRelease' ) }}.
