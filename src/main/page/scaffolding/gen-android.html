<h3><em>gen-android</em></h3>

<p>
	The {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} comes with a {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} task that works similar to {{ names.name( 'android' ) }}'s {{ command( 'create project' ) }} command. Using this approach has the advantge of automatically targeting your installed {{ names.abbreviation( 'android-sdk' ) }} installation. But to use it, it is necessary to install the plugin to the global {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} configuration. Then {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} will load the {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} on every usage, even if the project is unrelated to {{ names.name( 'scala-android' ) }}. This allows you to access the custom {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} commands (such as {{ command( 'gen-android' ) }}) before the project has actually been created.
</p>

<p>
	To install {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} globally, create the file {{ command( '~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/android.sbt' ) }} (the name is arbitrary) and insert {{ command( dependencies.sbtPlugin( 'sbt-plugin' ) ) }}.
</p>

{{ code( 'page/scaffolding/add-sbt-plugin.sh.html', 'bash' ) }}

<p>
	Now, if the {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} is available in the global {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} context, navigate to an empty application folder and run the {{ command( 'gen-android <platform-target> <package-name> <name>' | escape ) }} command.
</p>

{{ code( 'page/scaffolding/gen-android.sh.html', 'bash' ) }}

<p>
	This will create a very basic {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} setup, consisting of an example activity and a corresponding test class, some resources and the {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} configuration. All arguments are compulsory, but it appears like the last parameter {{ command( '<name>' | escape ) }} does not have an effect on the scaffolding process.

{% call alert( 'warning' ) %}
	Please make sure that the {{ command( './project/android.sbt' ) }} file remains in working order. It contains the dependency to the {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} which you don't nececcarily need, because you are already depending on it via the global configuration, but it is crucial for others to run your project.
