<h3>{{ names.name( 'gh' ) }} starter template (recommended)</h3>

<p>
	The easiest and also recommended way to get started, is to clone the {{ sourcelink( 'project-skeleton' ) }} and remove the {{ command( '.git/' ) }} folder. It contains a basic {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} <em>Hello World</em> configuration and is all set up, tweaked and documented to be used with the {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }}. It is definitely easier to start with this project and to gradually remove or change settings than starting from scratch and figure it all out by yourself.
