<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
	Developing with the Scala on Android toolchain is a considerably resource intensive undertaking. Depending on your
	editor and whether you keep emulators running during development or not, the memory consumption does vary greatly.
	You should be equipped with at least 4GB of RAM to cover the common use cases that are demonstrated in this
	documentation. Since compiling Scala code is known to be a tedious process, a fast CPU might improve this for you.

	<li>
		<h4>Java Development Kit (JDK)</h4>

		<p>
			Android supports Java 7, so the
			<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html" target="_blank">JDK 7</a>
			should also be your choice for now. If you already have a newer version of the JDK installed, this will work
			as well, but then you have to specify your compile target properly to version 1.7, which will
			be explained in the build tools topic.
		</p>

		{% call alert( warning ) %}
			<p>
				With the upcoming release of Scala 2.12,
				<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.12-roadmap" target="_blank">Java 8 will be required</a>. Therefore
				<strong>Scala 2.12 can not be used for Android development</strong> until Google introduces Java 8 support for
				Android.
			</p>

		<h4>Android Software Development Kit (SDK)</h4>

		<p>
			The Android SDK is a comprehensive tooling suite. It comes with applications that compile Java to Android
			bytecode, debugging and profiling applications, the Android emulator and
			<a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/help/index.html" target="_blank">a whole lot more</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other" target="_blank">Download</a> and
			<a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=tools" target="_blank">Install</a> the
			SDK. Then open your terminal and run {{ command( 'android sdk' ) }}. The <em>Android SDK Manager</em> window
			will pop up and ask you to install Android version specific documentation, development APIs, sources and
			disk images for emulation. For a quick start it is sufficient to stick with the default selection.

		<h4>Editor / IDE</h4>

		<p>
			You are basically free to use any editor of your choice. With IDEs like Android Studio the integration
			process might cause a little trouble. Please refer to the <a href="#">Editor / IDE</a> chapter for further
			information. The recommended tool is IntelliJ IDEA, which is also used as reference throughout the
			documentation.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Build System</h4>

		<p>
			Build tool integration plugins for Scala on Android are currently available for
			<a href="https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin" target="_blank">sbt</a>,
			<a href="https://github.com/saturday06/gradle-android-scala-plugin" target="_blank">Gradle</a> and
			<a href="https://github.com/simpligility/android-maven-plugin/tree/master/src/test/projects/scala" target="_blank">Maven</a>.
			sbt, the <em>Scala Build Tool</em>, is the Scala <em>de facto</em> build tool and its configuration files
			are also written in Scala. The <em>Android SDK Plugin</em> for sbt is a very mature and well
			maintained plugin, furthermore most Scala IDEs integrate sbt nicely. Therefore sbt is the build tool of
			choice for this documentation.
		</p>

		{% call alert( warning ) %}
			<p>
				If you do not have any experiences with Scala on Android and other build tools than sbt, it is highly
				recommended to chose sbt, since many parts of this documentation are focused on its configuration
				details!
			</p>
		{% endcall %}

		<p><a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html" target="_blank">Get sbt</a> from the official website.</p>
