<h2>Publishing</h2>

<p>
	If you test your app via {{ command( 'sbt run' ) }} during the development process, the app is automatically signed with a debug certificate. This does obviously not suffice in order to publish to the <em>Google Play</em> platform. When your app is ready for prime time and your <em>Google Developer Account</em> is set up, then it's about time to sign the {{ command( '*.apk' ) }} with the help of {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }}.
