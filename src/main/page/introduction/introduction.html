<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	{{ names.name( 'android' ) }} applications are usually developed with the {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} programming language and the {{ names.render( 'android-sdk' ) }}. The program code you write gets compiled to {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} bytecode and is then translated to so-called <em>Dalvik bytecode</em> (an {{ names.name( 'android' ) }}-specific format). On the actual device the {{ names.render( 'art' ) }} is then able to execute these instructions. For you, as an application developer, this process is entirely happening behind scenes and does not affect you. It does, however, leave you the freedom to decide how to generate your bytecode.

<p>
	Although {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} is the only officially supported and documented language to create {{ names.abbreviation( 'sdk' ) }} apps, {{ names.name( 'android' ) }}’s implicit compatibility with {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} bytecode opens the door to a variety of other {{ names.render( 'jvm' ) }} technologies. In fact, every {{ names.abbreviation( 'jvm' ) }} programming language that is able to interop with {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} programs might be used as a fully functional alternative to {{ names.name( 'java' ) }}.

<p>
	The {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} programming language is one out of several {{ names.abbreviation( 'jvm' ) }} technologies that fulfills this requirement. On top of that it covers most features of {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} and adds a variety of highly useful capabilities, such as: type inference, functional programing paradigms, actor-based concurrency and traits (as an improvement to {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} interfaces) to just mention a few of them. {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }}’s steadily growing community has recently created a couple of ambitious projects aiming to make {{ names.name( 'scala-android' ) }} a compelling experience.
