<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>
	{{ names.name( 'scala' ) }} comes with first class macro support (compile time reflection). This allows for code generation at compile time that may help to reduce boilerplate in use cases like this without sacrificing performance. To simplify {{ names.render( 'ipc' ) }} with the {{ names.name( 'parcelable' ) }} contract, you could instead try one of the numerous {{ names.name( 'json' ) }} libraries, or {{ sourcelink( 'scala-pickling' ) }}, a project that aims to bring boilerplate-free serialization to {{ names.name( 'scala' ) }}.
