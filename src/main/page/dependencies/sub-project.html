<h3>{{ names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }} sub-projects</h3>

<p>
	{{ names.abbr( 'sbt' ) }} allows you to split your codebase into several sub-modules. This might be a convenient way to manage large codebases. It also works for {{ names.name( 'sbt-plugin' ) }} projects. Please refer to the {{ sourcelink( 'sbt-tutorial-multi-projects', names.abbr( 'sbt' ) + ' documentation' ) }} to learn how such a setup is configured.
