<h3>You are not safe here</h3>

<p>
	Leaving the safe haven of {{ names.name( 'google' ) }}'s {{ names.name( 'java' ) }} environment does not come without a price. To enjoy the benefits of {{ names.name(  'scala-android' ) }} you have to not only sacrifice official tooling support and deal with longer compile times but you also have a much tougher build configuration ahead of you to get basic things working. If you still think that {{ names.name(  'scala' ) }} is worth the hassle, this documentation is there to guide you past the rough edges.
