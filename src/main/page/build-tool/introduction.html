<h2>Build Tool</h2>

<p>
	You need to decide which build tool should manage your dependencies, compile and deploy your application and deliver your signed {{ names.abbreviation( 'apk' ) }}s. The most popular solutions are {{ names.abbreviation( 'sbt' ) }} and {{ names.name( 'gradle' ) }}. Both tools have a community developed plugin for {{ names.name( 'scala-android' ) }} development.
