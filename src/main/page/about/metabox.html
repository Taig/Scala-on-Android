<h3>The <em>metabox</em></h3>

<p>
	Most sections on this website contain a <em>metabox</em> which you can access via the signal reception icon to the right of the headline.
</p>

<ol class="reception-icons">
	<li class="level-3"><span>Level 3</span></li>
	<li class="level-2"><span>Level 2</span></li>
	<li class="level-1"><span>Level 1</span></li>
</ol>

<p>
	The icon illustrates a categorization of the section's content in terms of information reliability.  A green, full signal reception bar indicates that the provided information are universally valid and are unlikely to become outdated. A red icon, on the opposite, indicated that the section could become outdated rather quickly.
</p>

<p>
	If you click the icon the <em>metabox</em> pops up. Containing the date of the paragraph's last edit, you can get an even better idea of the information sustainability. Furthermore, by clicking "Edit on {{ names.name( 'gh' ) }}" you jump right into an online text editor allowing you to update a section's information.
